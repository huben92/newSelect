Searchable select jquery


Change standard select jquery to searchable select. But the select html didn't change, it still like what it should be.

it will create lists after select
    <ul class="option_container">
        <li class="option"></li>
    </ul>

you can change the style of option-container by targeting css to .option_container and .option for option list.
